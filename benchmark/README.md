# Benchmark

A clean, provenance-logged benchmark that scores each locally-runnable model — and
combinations of models — per task type, to decide which single models and which
`virtual/agent` combos are worth serving. The repo's product is the server; this is the
tool that tells us what to put in it.

## Method

- **Backend:** OpenVINO **GenAI only** (the source-built engine in `.venv-genai`). One engine,
  no cross-engine confounds.
- **Task types (5 suites):** `codegen` · `edit` · `autocomplete-fim` · `agent-loop`
  · `analysis` (diagnose / plan / route / recall).
- **Scoring:** per (entry, task type) → **quality** = probe pass-rate, **runtime** = total
  wall-clock to solve the suite. Ranked **quality first, then total runtime**. tok/s is logged
  but is *never* the rank key — more tokens for the same task is not per se better.
- **Decoding:** every model runs at the operating point in **its card** (`cards/<owner>__<name>.yaml`):
  sampling for open-ended `codegen` (generative class), greedy for `edit`/`agent-loop`/`analysis`/`fim`
  (structured/fim classes — rule 0f). Best-of-N blocks on the non-deterministic VLM path.
- **Think:** per-task policy from the card — `nothink` for codegen/edit/autocomplete, `think`
  for analysis (where reasoning may help).
- **Provenance:** every run records the engine version, the model's quant recipe (read from the
  IR rt_info — qat/awq+se/data-free, mode, group_size, ratio, ASF), decoding, think, suite, date.
  → reproducible, and a **retest queue** of what to re-run on a newer engine/recipe.

### Two steps
1. **Single-model role-fitness** — `run_fleet.ps1` benchmarks each model solo across the task types.
2. **Combinations** — `run_combos.ps1` loads a `combos.yaml` combo into the `virtual/agent` roles
   (router/architect/executor/reviewer) and benchmarks `virtual/agent` on the same suites. A combo
   is just another peer row in the tables; the best-setup summary (single or combo) is in the root README.

## Run

```powershell
# Step 1 — single models (per-model solo server, all task types)
benchmark\scripts\run_fleet.ps1
benchmark\scripts\run_fleet.ps1 -Models "OpenVINO/Qwen3-14B-int4-ov" -Tasks codegen   # subset

# Step 2 — combinations
benchmark\scripts\run_combos.ps1

# regenerate the tables below + the root README best-setup summary
.venv-genai\Scripts\python.exe benchmark\scripts\assemble_leaderboard.py
.venv-genai\Scripts\python.exe benchmark\scripts\assemble_leaderboard.py --check   # preview only
```

Cards are generated from the on-disk fleet by `benchmark\scripts\scaffold_cards.py` (run it after
downloading a new model); hand-edit a card to pin a model's best-use decoding/think.

## Layout
- `cards/` (repo root) — per-model best-use config, shared with the server.
- `benchmark/combos.yaml` — named virtual/agent combinations.
- `benchmark/scripts/` — `bench_meta.py` (provenance + cards), `bench_run.py` (runner),
  `run_fleet.ps1` / `run_combos.ps1` (orchestrators), `assemble_leaderboard.py`, `bench_castings.py`
  / `bench_roles.py` / `bench_workloads.py` (probes), `hw/` (hardware microbenches).
- `benchmark/results/runs/*.jsonl` — provenance run-records (source of truth).

## Retest queue

- OpenVINO/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct-int4-ov: not yet run on codegen, edit, agent-loop

## Failures

**OpenVINO/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct-int4-ov / analysis**:
  - diagnose: FAIL (content='the error is that the function `median` is returning 3.5 when)
